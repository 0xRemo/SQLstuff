KEY INSIGHTS
----------------------------------------
1. MASSIVE VARIANCE IN SHOW PERFORMANCE: The top show (Venue 172618, 41,860 tickets) sold ~12x more than the lowest-selling show (Venue 57954, 3,520 tickets). This suggests very different venue capacities or market demand across cities.

2. UPSELL ATTACHMENT IS INCONSISTENT: Only 17 of 27 shows with sales data (63%) have any upsell ticket sales. The overall upsell rate is just 4.1% of total tickets. This represents a significant untapped revenue opportunity.

3. WHERE UPSELLS EXIST, THEY MATTER: Among the 17 shows that DO have upsell sales, the average upsell rate is 7.3%. The highest upsell rate is at Venue 9463 (13.9%). Venues with upsell infrastructure consistently generate incremental revenue.

4. TOP SHOWS DON'T NEED UPSELLS TO WIN: The #1 show (Venue 172618) has 0.0% upsell rate — its dominance comes purely from concert ticket volume. Meanwhile, smaller shows like Venue 9463 and Venue 475421 lean more heavily on upsells to boost total numbers.

5. DATA GAPS: 6 of 33 shows have zero ticket sales rows. These should be investigated — they may be future on-sale dates or data pipeline issues.
